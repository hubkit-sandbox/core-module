/**
 * OwnerId is used to "soft link" an entity to either a specific AbstractUser, or system.
 *
 * There are two special types: `internal` and `private`, which both use
 * a static id value to indicate there purpose.
 *
 * - Internal is managed by the system itself and used for platform configuration.
 *   Mainly the VirtualHost configuration of the hosting-management application
 *   is marked as `internal`, and reseller entry points.
 *
 * - Private marks the Entity is only accessible by Administrators, this used
 *   for corporate e-mail mailboxes and company owned websites.
 *
 * A `personal` id owner contains the AbstractUserId to realize a linkage between the
 * bounded contexts.
 *
 * Note: An Entity can only ever owned by a single user, not a group of users.
